We evaluate our NSGA-II-based approach using real SCADA data from a 3 MW direct-drive wind turbine located in southern Ireland.
The replication package contains:

1.  the used dataset for each fault.
2.  The results obtained from machine learning algorithms including LSTM.
3.  The results obtained from MOEAs.
4.  The generated tree for each wind turbine fault.
